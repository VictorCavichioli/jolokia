== Jolokia Java Client library

The Jolokia Java client bindings provide typeless access to a
remote JMX `MBeanServer`. Its programming model follows a
request-response paradigm and is easy to use:

[source,java,options=nowrap]
----
JolokiaClient jolokiaClient = new JolokiaClientBuilder().url("http://localhost:8080/jolokia")
        .user("jolokia")
        .password("jolokia")
        .build();
JolokiaReadRequest req = new JolokiaReadRequest("java.lang:type=Memory", "HeapMemoryUsage");
req.setPath("used");
JolokiaReadResponse resp = jolokiaClient.execute(req);
System.out.println("Memory used: " + resp.getValue());
----

This client library is described in detail with all
configuration options in the
link:../reference/html/manual/clients.html#client-java[reference manual].
