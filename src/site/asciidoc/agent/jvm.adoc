== JVM Agent

Another variant is Jolokia's JVM agent which does not need any special container
environment. The only dependency is on Oracle's JDK 11 or later as runtime,
since it contains a lightweight HTTP Server used for
exposing the Jolokia protocol. This agent is the most generic one which can
instrument _any_ Java application using a JDK11+. It is suitable for
situations where the other agents don't fit. Also, it can be used for dynamically
attaching an agent to a running Java process (this option however https://openjdk.org/jeps/451[is going to be removed after JDK 21,role=externalLink,window=_blank]).

For using this agent, the following argument to the Java
application to instrument has to be given:

[,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ java ... -javaagent:/path/to/jolokia-agent-jvm-{jolokia-version}-javaagent.jar
----

By default, the agent will listen on port 8778, but this can be configured
as well as other aspects like authentication:

* Provide options on the commandline as key-value pairs:
+
[,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ java ... -javaagent:jolokia-agent-jvm-{jolokia-version}-javaagent.jar=port=7777,host=localhost
----
* Via a properties file
+
[,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ java ... -javaagent:jolokia-agent-jvm-{jolokia-version}-javaagent.jar=config=/path/to/config.properties
----
* Via packaging a `jolokia-agent.properties` top level in the `agent.jar`

Options are used in the given precedence, the former overwriting
the later values.

Additionally if options are not specified, Jolokia uses several _property sources_:

* default values stored in code
* values stored in `default-jolokia-agent.properties` resource file in JVM Agent JAR
* environment variables prefixed with `JOLOKIA_`. So for example `agentId` option can be specified using `JOLOKIA_AGENT_ID` environment variable
* system properties prefixed with `jolokia.` So for example `host` option can be specified using `-Djolokia.host` option for `java` invocation.

For attaching the agent dynamically to a running Java process, the following
command can be used to get a quick help

[,subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
$ java -jar /path/to/jolokia-agent-jvm-{jolokia-version}-javaagent.jar --help
----

NOTE: Dynamic loading of agents will be removed at some point. See https://openjdk.org/jeps/451[JEP 451,role=externalLink,window=_blank] for details.
